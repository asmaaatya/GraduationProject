After research, we found that the percentage of food waste in the whole world in 2021 reached 
1.2 billion tons, and the largest percentage was in the Arab world, especially in Egypt, especially 
during Ramadan. It was found that food waste affects the environment, as it leads to the emission 
of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide. When we searched, we found that food waste results 
from hotels, restaurants, homes, weddings and funerals.
The goal of this application is to reduce food waste and preserve the environment within the 
framework of implementing Egypt's 2030 vision and achieving one of the sustainable 
development goals (eradicating hunger and preserving the environment).
The application has two users, the first of which is the person who has food in excess of his need, 
and the other who needs food
